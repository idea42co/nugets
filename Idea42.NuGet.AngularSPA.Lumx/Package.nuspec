      We love Angular... We also love SPA's (Single Page Apps)! So, at Idea42, we created this starter kit that gets you going with the best known practices for creating an Angular SPA!

      In addition to our love to SPA's, we also love Material Design! And with two awesome frameworks out there, we give you two builds with these included! We present to you a Angular SPA with Lumx preinstalled. (http://ui.lumapps.com/) 
      
      Lumx succeeds where Angular Material fails in regards to IE, so if this is a requirement, you should check out Lumx!

      To begin using this template pack, start by creating an empty ASP.NET web project, add this package to the project, and we will take care of the rest.
